In my frontend i created multiple files for my landingpage how my website will look like, and added css for them so that  they can be displayed the way i want. In that i added login, signup  etc buttons to navigate  between pages and in my signup page if the username or email already exist a alert will popup sayin username or email already exist.

I created different pages for each topic in my for example for adding a new user and there data, or login or signup for them i created a new page.

I used routes for connecting them to my website so that i can move through without facing any challenges.
