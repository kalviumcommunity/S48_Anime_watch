Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB

In my backend i connected my Mongodb DataBase to my backend. I created Schema and JOI Validation for Login, SignIn, Logout, addList etc to connect to my server so that i can connect them to my database.

In my routes.js i created a dummy data  for testing if my code is working in bruno or not.

In my server.js i created a data Base connection and used the express framework to create an application. I also included body-parser middleware javascript. In that i used some code to add data from frontend to backend and them to my database in that i have created for add data, updating data, deleting data, adding login, adding signin, logout etc. to add or remove from my database.
